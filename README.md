### Research Question
How can technology be designed to improve the accessibility of cutting and pasting files and text, as well as scrolling on a computer, for individuals with limited use of their limbs, such as Nicolette, who use speech software and drawing tablets to navigate?

### Problem Definition
Nicolette Besemer has little control over her limbs, leading to several problems that reoccur in her every-day life. Nicolette mentioned she struggles a lot to copy and paste text and files since she cannot use the short cut `crtl + c` and `crtl + v`. This is not the only problem she faces, since she cannot drag and hold her stylus on her tablet she struggles to `scroll down and up` on pages. Nicolette would love a solution that implements features that solve these challenges that would also work without using her speech program.

### Solution to problem
In my solution I made a little menu in the bottom right corner of the screen like the following:

#### What do the buttons do? 
* `Start-button` ▶️: Place the cursor somewhere in the text, press the start button and then replace your cursor at the same position in the text again, this will start the selection.
* `Stop-button` 🚫: This will stop the selection
* `Copy-button` ✂️: This will copy the text to the local storage and gives you an alert which text has been copied
* `Paste-button` 🖌️: This will paste the copied text from the local storage to the paste area.
* `Scroll-down-button` 🔽: One click moves it down a bit, holding it speeds up the scrolling.
* `Scroll-up-button` 🔼: One click moves it up a bit, holding it speeds up the scrolling.
* `Erupt-button` ♨️: This will make a vulcanic eruption happen at the corner of your screen.

## User persona 👩🏻‍🦽
**Name:** Nicolette Besemer

**Demographics:** Middle-aged woman with limited use of her limbs, uses a wheelchair to get around 

**Behaviors:** Enjoys visiting natural wonders, passionate about nature, does a lot of organizing for the neighborhood and for other volunteers

**Goals/Motivations:** Concerned with accessibility, wants to be able to copy and paste files and text more easily, wants to improve scrolling function 

**Context:** Nicolette is working on her computer at home, using speech software and a drawing tablet to navigate. She needs to cut and paste files into folders, but finds it difficult to do so with her limited use of her limbs. She also needs to copy and paste text, but this is challenging with her speech software. She is concerned about accessibility and wants to find a solution that is easy to use, as some technologies can be difficult for her to understand. 

**Task:** Nicolette wants to be able to cut and paste files into folders more easily, and to be able to copy and paste text without difficulty. She also wants to improve the scrolling function on her computer. 

**Actions:** Nicolette tries to use her drawing tablet to cut and paste files into folders, but finds this difficult due to her limited control over her limbs. She also attempts to use her speech software to copy and paste text, but struggles with accuracy and placing the text in the correct location. When scrolling, Nicolette finds it challenging to control the movement of her arm and experiences spasms, making it difficult to navigate on her computer. 

**Challenges:** Nicolette finds it difficult to cut and paste files and text due to her limited use of her limbs and speech software. She also experiences challenges when scrolling due to her spasms and difficulty controlling her arm movements. 

**Outcomes:** Nicolette would like a solution that would make it easier for her to cut and paste files and text, and to improve the scrolling function on her computer. She would like the solution to be accessible and easy to use, and would prefer if it did not require her to learn complex technologies. One solution she suggests is a menu that appears when she clicks a button or speaks a command, which would allow her to quickly select copy, paste, or other options with her drawing tablet. This would allow her to navigate more easily without needing to scroll or double-click.
