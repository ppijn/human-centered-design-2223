She would like the solution to be accessible and easy to use, and would prefer if it did not require her to learn complex technologies. One solution she suggests is a menu that appears when she clicks a button or speaks a command, which would allow her to quickly select copy, paste, or other options with her drawing tablet. This would allow her to navigate more easily without needing to scroll or double-click.
