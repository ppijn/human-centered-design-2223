Nicolette Besemer has little control over her limbs, leading to several problems that reoccur in her every-day life. Nicolette mentioned she struggles a lot to copy and paste text and files since she cannot use the short cut `crtl + c` and `crtl + v`. This is not the only problem she faces, since she cannot drag and hold her stylus on her tablet she struggles to `scroll down and up` on pages. Nicolette would love a solution that implements features that solve these challenges that would also work without using her speech program.
