### Research Question
How can technology be designed to improve the accessibility of cutting and pasting files and text, as well as scrolling on a computer, for individuals with limited use of their limbs, such as Nicolette, who use speech software and drawing tablets to navigate?

### Problem Definition
Nicolette Besemer has little control over her limbs, leading to several problems that reoccur in her every-day life. Nicolette mentioned she struggles a lot to copy and paste text and files since she cannot use the short cut `crtl + c` and `crtl + v`. This is not the only problem she faces, since she cannot drag and hold her stylus on her tablet she struggles to `scroll down and up` on pages. Nicolette would love a solution that implements features that solve these challenges that would also work without using her speech program.

### Solution to problem
In my solution I made a little menu in the bottom right corner of the screen like the following:

#### What do the buttons do? 
* `Start-button` ▶️: Place the cursor somewhere in the text, press the start button and then replace your cursor at the same position in the text again, this will start the selection.
* `Stop-button` 🚫: This will stop the selection
* `Copy-button` ✂️: This will copy the text to the local storage and gives you an alert which text has been copied
* `Paste-button` 🖌️: This will paste the copied text from the local storage to the paste area.
* `Scroll-down-button` 🔽: One click moves it down a bit, holding it speeds up the scrolling.
* `Scroll-up-button` 🔼: One click moves it up a bit, holding it speeds up the scrolling.
* `Erupt-button` ♨️: This will make a vulcanic eruption happen at the corner of your screen.

## User persona 👩🏻‍🦽
**Name:** Nicolette Besemer

**Demographics:** 76 year old woman with limited use of her limbs, uses a wheelchair to get around 

**Behaviors:** Enjoys visiting natural wonders, passionate about nature, does a lot of organizing for the neighborhood and for other volunteers

**Goals/Motivations:** Concerned with accessibility, wants to be able to copy and paste files and text more easily, wants to improve scrolling function 

**Context:** Nicolette is working on her computer at home, using speech software and a drawing tablet to navigate. She needs to cut and paste files into folders, but finds it difficult to do so with her limited use of her limbs. She also needs to copy and paste text, but this is challenging with her speech software. She is concerned about accessibility and wants to find a solution that is easy to use, as some technologies can be difficult for her to understand. 

**Task:** Nicolette wants to be able to cut and paste files into folders more easily, and to be able to copy and paste text without difficulty. She also wants to improve the scrolling function on her computer. 

**Actions:** Nicolette tries to use her drawing tablet to cut and paste files into folders, but finds this difficult due to her limited control over her limbs. She also attempts to use her speech software to copy and paste text, but struggles with accuracy and placing the text in the correct location. When scrolling, Nicolette finds it challenging to control the movement of her arm and experiences spasms, making it difficult to navigate on her computer. 

**Challenges:** Nicolette finds it difficult to cut and paste files and text due to her limited use of her limbs and speech software. She also experiences challenges when scrolling due to her spasms and difficulty controlling her arm movements. 

**Outcomes:** Nicolette would like a solution that would make it easier for her to cut and paste files and text, and to improve the scrolling function on her computer. She would like the solution to be accessible and easy to use, and would prefer if it did not require her to learn complex technologies. One solution she suggests is a menu that appears when she clicks a button or speaks a command, which would allow her to quickly select copy, paste, or other options with her drawing tablet. This would allow her to navigate more easily without needing to scroll or double-click.

## Prototypes 🛠️
In order to come up with this I had to create some rapid prototypes and sketch out multiple creative ideas that could give me inspiration that would take me into the first testing round.

These solutions all made use of the technologies Nicolette uses on an everyday basis but I tried to sometimes only use certain technologies to generate more ideas. To see the in-depth research done for all the prototypes and test results see the Wiki of this gitHub page, or press this link: https://github.com/ppijn/human-centered-design-2223/wiki/Nicolette-Research-and-Testing-details

### Testing round 1️⃣ 
In this first testing round on April the 20th, we got the chance to ask a few questions to Nicolette and get to know her and the problems she faces. I created the prototype sketched showed before and due to that I got the chance to ask her certain questions that might have been left unanswered but that were pretty important for this project. In this question round we got to really know Nicolette and start creating the first prototype based on that.

**Goal:** The goal of this round was to understand her problems, ask our questions and get to know Nicolette.

**Iteration/ Results:** With her answers we now know her real problem is with scrolling, copy and pasting files, and she would love it if she would be able to also copy and paste certain text elements on websites to use in her articles. 



### Testing round 2️⃣
In the second testing round on April the 26th, we had the chance to meet with Nicolette again, but this time we got to show our prototypes to her and see how she interacts with it. In my prototype I had already created the menu with each button and almost all my functions and buttons worked, so I got to show her a 80% done prototype. During this time the main thing was to really watch her reactions, ask for feedback and see what I could improve to make the prototype even more to her liking.

**Goal:** The goal of this round was to test my prototype and test each element and document her reaction.

**Iteration/ Results:** Nicolette really enjoyed the prototype mentioning over and over again that she liked the features, having it all in one clear designed and easy to understand place was exactly what she wanted. There were a few features that I sadly didn't get to show to her but the overall results were very promosing! Next to that all she laughed a good amount at the vulcanic eruption feature which could be clicked anytime you want to have a bit of a laugh.

## Design Principles 

### Study Situation 💻
The first time we read about the challenge Nicolette faces, it was very clearly stated it had to do with the fact that she struggles to `copy` and `paste`. Our challenge was to come up with a solution that would solve this issue. But, when we actually got to speak to Nicolette, it turned out that there where some more challenges that she faces which might have actually been more annoying for her. The fact that she struggels to `scroll` since dragging movements are difficult for her becuase of the little control she has over her limbs, and the sudden spasms she could get. 

After studying her and her behaviour, it was clear as she mentioned it many times that she would love to be able to scroll, while also being able to copy and paste text from websites into her documents. Since Nicolette is 76 years old, we asked her about her technological capabilities and for her age and disability she can get along with technology very good! However, she stated that we shouldn't make it too complicated as she mentioned that there probably are already a bunch of solutions to her challenges, but she just doesn't want to take the time to read up on them. So this means our solution should be clear, precise, easy to understand and solve her challenges.

### Prioritise Identity 🆔
Nicolette is a very kind person, she loves to smile and is just very nice to talk to. I really enjoyed having her as my client to solve an issue for her, since it felt like the potential solution could really be a make or break situation for her. Solving these issues will really improve her day to day life in both her work and personal and mental well being. 

Having said that, to design this project I realy tried to stick to her needs and identity. Meaning we choose to go for more natural colours, make clear icons, have a hover text on each button explaining what it does and writing some geological text as a placeholder for this project. Nicolette mentioned she would like the application to also work without speech, since a lot of the times she doesn't want to yell in public spaces to her computer since she will feel bad for the other people. So for this application, I specifically made it so it works with her wacom tablet and not (yet) with her voice.

### Ignore Conventions ❌
I kind of ignored her whole challenge, which was to be able to copy and paste in her files! The challenge description was very open and we knew it was copying and pasting, but not exactly what she will be copying and pasting. Since copying and pasting files is something that was just a little bit too difficult for her to understand, I decided to focus on some other issues she mentioned that weren't the challenge. 
* Being able to scroll up and down
* Being able to copy certain pieces of a text on websites and paste it where she wants

Stepping away from the intital challenge is what happens in normal life as well, when you think you want something to be solved for you, most of the times its not the case. Take this quote: `"Consumers are stupid, and they know what they want. But if you give them what they want they don’t want it. It needs to be disruptive, destructive and impressive."` 

This is saying that whenever you go to someone to solve an issue for you, like for example a toothbrush. If this toothbrush is designed to be exactly like the consumer wants it to be, they will not be impressed and most of times, will not even use it. That is why being disruptive and impressive will make a difference. If I were to now design a toothbrush for this "client" and make it something they absolutely did not think about, but it will still solve their issues, they will be more impressed and will use it a lot more then you think. 

Using this way of thinking, I decided to exactly that. Design something different from her challenge, make it more impressive and adding more features she might have not thought about in the first place will leave a greater impression, and therefore will give me a more satisfied client.


### Add Nonsense 🔥
In order to make this project and solution even more interesting and personal or Nicolette, I decided to add a secret (not so secret) button. Because Nicolette loves nature, visiting natural wonders and the fact that she used to be an geologist, I decided to make this secret button the so called `ERUPT` button! What happens when you press this button? Well, a certain vulcanic eruption will spew fire in the bottom left corner of your screen. This feature was added just to make Nicolette laugh (which she did when testing!) and just to make her day a little bit more exciting whenever she is down or is bored. When testing this feature I got a very good laugh out of Nicolette, who was already curious for this button since I showed her my screen. This so called 'nonsense' was a great succes and added that little personal touch to this project and will make Nicolette laugh at the times she needs it.
